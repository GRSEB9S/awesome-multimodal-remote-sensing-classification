# Awesome Multi-modal Remote Sensing Classification



## 1. Dataset

- [Houston2013 (Hyperspectral and LiDAR Data)](https://hyperspectral.ee.uh.edu/?page_id=459)

  The data sets distributed for the Contest included an HSI, a LiDAR-derived digital surface model (DSM), both at the same spatial resolution (2.5 m), as well as the LiDAR point cloud. The HSI had 144 bands in the 380–1050 nm spectral region. The corresponding co-registered DSM represented the elevation in meters above sea level (per the Geoid 2012 A model). The “las” file of the LiDAR point cloud was also provided. Paper: [Debes et al.2014](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/6776408)

- [LCZ Data (Multi-spectral and SAR data)](https://github.com/danfenghong/IEEE_TGRS_MDL-RS)

  The LCZ data sets are collected from Sentinel-2 and Sentinel-1 satellites, where the former acquires the MS data with ten spectral bands and the latter is able to generate the dual-polarimetric SAR data organized as a commonly used PolSAR covariance matrix (four components).
